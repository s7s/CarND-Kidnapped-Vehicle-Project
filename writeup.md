**Particle Filter Project**

The goals of this project are the following:

* Implement the Particle filter algorithm
* Run the implemented algorithm on the simulator
* Summarize the results with a written report



## Project Basics
In this project, I used C++ to write a program taking a map and sensor data to know the position of a kidnapped vehicle using Particle Filters.

See files in the 'src' folder for the primary C++ files making up this project.
